###Abstract: 

Theory indicates that at their thresholds, biomes with alternative states can be tipped from one state to another by small changes in the environment, making these systems particularly susceptible to future environmental changes. Non-linear responses to changes in climate observed across space have driven fears of future biome instability and forest collapse. However, observations of threshold responses of alternative states to temporal shifts in environmental factors are lacking. We show that before Agro-industrial land conversion in the 1800’s, large regions of North America existed as bi-stable alternative states, but over ~150 years of land use change and fire suppression have stabilized (212,032 sq. km) the landscape. Projecting into the future, climate would destabilize alternative states in the region, but continued human impacts will maintain stability under changes in climate.


###Main Text:  

  Anthropogenic environmental changes are expected to alter the function and distribution of ecosystems and biomes across the globe. Response to these changes may be a continuous response to climate, or a non-linear threshold response in the case of unstable systems maintained by ecological feedback mechanisms (Scheffer et al. 2001). Biomes that can take alternative states within the same environmental space are considered particularly unstable to environmental changes. In these systems, vegetation-environment feedback mechanisms maintain one of the alternative states over a range of environmental space, but at a critical threshold, or ‘tipping point,’ small perturbations of the environment can result in non-linear transitions in vegetation. Thus, the responses of alternative stable states at these "tipping points" can theoretically drive rapid biome shifts, driving fears of unpredictable responses to future environmental changes (Staver et al. 2011, Scheffer et al. 2001). 

Observations of non-linear transitions of tree cover in space indicate that tropical savanna and forests are one such example of alternate stable states maintained by feedbacks between disturbance and canopy openness. The existence of these alternative states over large regions drives widespread concern over the continued stability of tropical forests, and suggests large scale shifts in forest cover are possible under altered climate (Staver et al. 2011, Hirota et al. 2011). However, most studies of alternative states are limited to short timescales, space for-time-substitutions, or small spatial scales, in the case of lake tropic states (CITE lake stuff) on the modern landscape. Consequentially, we currently lack insight into how a large biome with alternative states will actually respond and whether they will be destabilized or stabilized by future environmental changes. 

To explore the responses of alternative states to environmental changes at the biome level, we examine the stability of vegetation at the North American savanna-forest boundary before agro-European settlement in the region, and on the modern landscape. During the period since Argo-Industrial settlement in the mid-1800’s land use changes, fire suppression, and climate shifts marked this region, providing a natural opportunity to assess stability before and after large scale environmental changes. Specifically, we ask whether temperate savanna and forests were alternative states in the past, determine if these systems were resilient to large scale fire suppression, land use change, and shifts in climate over the last ~150 years in the region.  Historical baseline tree density is estimated from Public Land Surveys (PLS) across five states in the Upper Midwest (Supplemental figure of tree density maps). We focus on tree density as a metric of stand structure in this analysis because feedbacks between vegetation structure and disturbances maintain savanna and forest alternative states elsewhere (Staver et al. 2011). Due to these disturbance-vegetation feedbacks, a hallmark of alternative states is a bimodal or discontinuous distribution in tree cover/density that not explained by environmental discontinuities. Though it has long been suggested that fire disturbances modified vegetation-climate relationships and were likely determinants of vegetation structure and composition in the pre-settlement Midwest (Grimm 1984, Umbanhauer CITE another key), the consequences of these theoretical mechanisms for ecosystem stability and environmental changes have not been explored. 

Before European Agricultural settlement in the Midwest, tree density was significantly bimodal across the entire Upper Midwest, with prominent modes at low tree density (30 trees/ha) and at high tree density (205 trees/ha) (Diptest p < 0.05, BC = 0.74306, Figure 1a). These modes are remarkably consistent with previous classifications of savanna (0.5 - 47 trees/ha) and forest (> 47 trees/ha), indicating that the observed bimodality separates low density savannas from high density closed forests (Goring et al. 2015, Anderson et al 1999). We evaluated tree density distributions over intervals of the scaled first principal component (PC1) of climate and soil factor variables from the past: Mean Annual Precipitation, Mean annual temperature, Precipitation Seasonality Index, Temperature Coefficient of Variation, percent sand, and available water content of the soil (Methods, Supplemental Material).  The bimodal distribution in PLS tree density is not due to discontinuous pattern in the climate or soil factors. Rather, tree density was significantly bimodal within intermediate precipitation and temperature levels (530 - 900 mm/year and 2 - 10 degC, PC1 range) (Figure 1b).  Similar to the distribution of tree cover in the tropics, very low mean annul precipitation results in low tree density, while savanna and forest states coexist at intermediate and high precipitation (Staver et al. 2011, Hirota et al. 2011). In contrast to the warm tropics, seasonal and spatial variability of temperature also plays an important role in defining the intermediate climate space where savanna and forest are alternative states.

Based on the climate space where tree density was bimodal in the past, we estimate that up to 34% (212,032 km^2) of the Midwest consisted of alternative savanna and forests states that could potentially switch between two bistable states (Figure 1c). Marked shifts in climate have occurred since the beginning of the 20th century in the region , driving higher temperatures, and changes to mean annual rainfall over the last century (USGCRP (2014)). Higher mean annual temperatures, altered precipitation seasonality, and greater summer drought stress on trees typically have negative consequences for tree growth, and in theory, could drive the collapse of some forests to savanna states (Allen and Breshears 1998, Frelich and Reich 2009). When we project the PLS era vegetation – environment relationship forward using modern climate, the observed climate shifts should have increase the region where vegetation bi-stability occurs by XX % (Supplemental Figure). This predicted expansion would destabilize previously stable closed forests and result in bimodal closed forests that could be tipped into savannas.

Climate changes were not the only environmental changes acting on the Midwest in over the course of the 20th century. Fire suppression (CITE USFS figure from Abrams), and large scale land use change (Rhemtulla et al. 2009, Goring et al. 2016) have both shaped the distribution of  vegetation on the landscape, and likely had competing effects on regional stability with climate shifts. Both fire suppression and land use changes would likely favor forest growth over savannas, and remove the hypothesized feedbacks driving alternative states by removing disturbance-vegetation feedbacks from the region and converting forests to agricultural and logging uses.   If the destabilizing impacts of climate shifts on biome stability outweigh the stabilizing influence of anthropogenic land use and fire suppression changes, then ecosystems on the modern landscape should have a higher probability of tipping between two states. 

After  150 years of environmental changes in the region , we find that Modern tree density distribution from the modern Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) is not significantly bimodal between 0 and 500 trees/ha, showing a sharp stabilization of the landscape to closed forests (Figure 1d). This stabilization is largely driven by an increase in density in historically savanna dominated regions, while historically dense closed forests have decreased in tree density (Linear reg., R^2 = 0.4, p < 0.05, Figure 1e). In sharp contrast to the increased bistability  predicted by the changes to modern climate, modern vegetation data tell the story of overall stabilization of the modern landscape to pre-dominantly stable closed forests (Figure 1f), indicating that human impacts on the land, not climate have stabilized the landscape to modern forests. 

Human driven changes in ecosystem stability in the region have practical consequences for the future responses of vegetation to climate. Dynamic vegetation model projections for the region typically use modern vegetation-climate relationships as baseline, but our analysis demonstrates a very different vegetation-climate relationship is possible for the region. To explore the implications of this, we predict regional stability under future climate using the past relationship between climate/soils and tree density. Using the past stability regime, climate changes projected under the RCP 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP 8.5 emissions scenarios (for CMIP5 CCESM4 climate projections) would result in a 1-5% increase of regional instability, and drive shifts in the location of alternative states of Midwestern forests (Figure 4a). This increase in instability due to warmer and drier future climate could result in Midwestern forest collapse to a savanna state (Frelich and Reich 2008). However, the current regime of fire suppression is likely to remain (CITE), and starting with a modern relationship between climate/soils and modern vegetation, the climate changes projected under the RCP 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP 8.5 emissions scenarios (again for CCESM4 only) would likely result in stable closed forests in the Midwest, maintaining, or increasing ecosystem stability (Figure 4b). Future climate shifts alone would destabilize the region, but continued human impacts result in a future of continued stability. 

Consistent with savanna and forest alternative stable states throughout the tropics, we document sharp transitions in tree cover with small changes in the environment at the past savanna forest ecotone. .  We go beyond simply documenting alt. states  by demonstrating actual shifts in stability with temporal environmental changes. Rather than observing climate change driven forest collapse, such as that feared in the tropics, we identify a switch from bistable forests and savannas to stable closed forests over ~150 years of environmental change.  Climate shifts in the region would predict increased bistability of savannas and forests, the stabilization effects of land use,fire suppression, and potentially CO2 fertilization dominate on the modern landscape. Therefore, at least for the temperate zone, human impacts on the land have stabilized future responses to climatic shifts. However, similar to the tropics, changes in disturbance regimes could return the region to historically bistable state, but it would require large land manager effort to maintain and convert stable forests to savanna ecosystems. While the last 150 years of environmental changes are regional phenomena, their effects on stability are globally relevant, as savannas and forests worldwide are currently dealing with the combined effects of climate changes and anthropogenic land use changes (CITE).

The predicted dominance of stable closed forests on the future landscape is contingent on the current disturbance regimes and modern vegetation-climate relationships. However, this does not preclude the possibility that drastic climate changes could drive large scale changes in tree mortality and tree density.  Forest growth may be particularly susceptible to climate-driven collapse in regions where no- analog climates will be much hotter and drier than historically observed in the region (Allen and Breshears 1998, Frelich and Reich 2009). Our modern climate-vegetation relationships can be a source of uncertainty in future projections because the region’s modern forests are regenerating/recovering from logging or agricultural use (Rhemtulla et al. 2009), resulting in vegetation that is less tightly correlated modern climate and environmental covariates (supplemental figure). The dependence of the modern vegetation-environment relationship on land-use, rather than local environmental factors may confound our understanding of vegetation response to climate and large scale limits on tree growth. While our future vegetation projections are do not explicitly include coupling of land use and climate, or mechanistic properties, by examining both the historic and modern vegetation-climate relationships, our analysis provides two possible scenarios for the future.

This analysis has the benefit of drawing on actual responses of regional vegetation to long term changes in climate, land use, and fire regime to assess resilience of alternative stable states to environmental changes. However, due to the current lack of regional environmental change datasets, we are unable to quantify the effect size of each of the non-climatic environmental changes.  We can conclude that land use changes, including both fire suppression and deforestation/logging likely played a large role in reshaping the Midwestern landscape, but cannot quantify the role of each of these factors. Researchers have strongly tied Midwestern forest composition to the legacy impacts of historical land use (Rhemtulla et al. 2009), and post-logging forest regeneration often cited as a large driver of the North American terrestrial carbon sink (Myneni et al. 2001, CITE other key ). Better regional reconstructions of the disturbances through time utilizing networks of lake sediment charcoal records, and tree ring fire scars are needed to attribute fire suppression as a mechanism for increased forest growth. Increased atmospheric CO2 is an additional human impact that is often overlooked in the Midwest, but CO2 driven increases forest growth and forest regeneration would theoretically aid development of stable closed forests in the region. There is little evidence for large scale CO2 fertilization based on tree ring growth networks in Europe (Franks et al. 2015) and across tropical forests (van der Sleen 2015), but an assessment of similar regional magnitude is needed in North America to rule out CO2 as a large player in the Midwest. 

Here we take advantage of a historical vegetation dataset and ~150 years of human and climate induced environmental changes to document alternative savanna and forest stable states in along a temperate ecotone, and to determine the response of alternative states to environmental changes. This study documents a biome with alternative savanna and forest states outside of the tropics and is is the first to document the stabilization of alternative states to a single stable state in response to climate shifts and land use changess. We document that the alternative forest and savanna states underwent regional shifts in stability with land use and fire regime changes in the 20th century. However, contrary to fears of closed forest collapse, vegetation shifted from alternative states to stable closed forest. This shift in stability will likely drive future stability, rather than large vegetation shifts in the face of climatic changes in the region, provided land use and fire suppression remain.


Outline:
1. Alternative stable states may drive unpredictable responses to environmental changes
2. Alt stable states have been documented, suggesting large scal shifts in response ot climate changes are possible, BUT no one has really documented this.  (additionally, alternative stable states are prominent among the tropics, but are theoretically possible anywhere where disturbances are an important driver of vegetation)
3. We test this using  PLS vegetation data to compare to modern data to look at responses to actual environmental changes. We also look for evidence of alt. states in the past in the temperate zon e.
4. Past vegetation consisted of savanna and forest alternative states. Similar to the tropics, these occur at intermediate climates. 
5. We estimate that XX% of the land was bistable in the past. Climate shift over the last century increased prevalence of this climate space. If these small climate shifts resulted in a threshold response, we would expect increases in bistable forest/savannas on the modern landscape. 
6. But climate change, fire suppression, land use change all co-occurred over the last century….These forces likely had competing effects on the vegetation stablility. 
7. The modern landscape is now mostly stable closed forests—land use and fire suppression dominated
8.  What are the consequences of this stabilization for the future?
9. This analysis indicates that past temperate savannas and forests functioned similarly to the tropics…AND we document a biome-scale shift in stability due to environmental change. 
10. This stability shift has consequences for the future. but our future projections depend on continued land use/ fire suppression. However, climate changes predicted for no-analog climate may outweigh the stabilizing effects of land use change and destabilize the landscape into the future. 
11. We have some limitations: data availability, we are unable to quatify the effect size of fire suppression, land use change, and CO2 with current data. Further work: quantifying the effects of CO2 on tree establishment and tree growth across the region. Quantifying land use changes as well

*Generalized Additive Models/Relationship between historic vegetation and climate/soil variables*

Gam model selection for the model with the lowest AIC value yeilded the model: tree density ~ s(MAP) + s(mean annual temperatue) + s(deltaT) + s(deltaP) + s(sandpct) + s(awc). While AIC suggests this is the best model (Table 1), it only explains 61% of the Deviance and has high Mean squared prediction error for predicting the test data set (MSPE = 5976.366). Prediction of tree density is overestimated in low tree denisty grid cells and underestimated in high tree denisty grid cells.  

The Gam model for the modern landscape explained only 29 % of the deviance and had a high mean squared prediction error for predicting the test data set (MSPE = XXXX). Prediction of tree density is again overestimated in low tree denisty grid cells and underestimated in high tree density grid cells. 


## Supplemental Methods:
*Public Land Survey Data:*
The Public Land Survey was commissioned by the U.S. General Land Office to assess the quality of land/timber and assign land titles for Euro-american settlers. The surveyors placed corner posts at 1 mile section corners in a grid within each township. At these section corners, and at 1/4 section corners, the surveyors would record the distance and azimuth from the corner to the nearest two trees, the species of the nearest two trees, and the diameter at breast height (DBH) of those trees. After these historic records were digitized (cite Mladenoff et al. ), we estimate the denisty and basal area at each corner point using the unbiased morista density estimator with correction factors for surveyor bias (@goring_2016, CITE Cogbill). Tree density is averaged across 8km x 8km grid cells in the upper Midwest.

*Forest Inventory Analysis Data:*

Add FIA data methods from Sean/Simon/Jack. FIA estimated tree denisty is also aggregated to the same 8km raster grid resolution.

*Climate Data*

  Mean annual temperature and Mean annual Precipitation data for the modern and historic vegetation-climate relationships are from PRISM datasets. Modern mean annual temperature and precipitation fore each 8km grid cell is calculated from the 800m 30-year Normals dataset. Historical climate is estimated as the average annual Temperature and average annual Precipiation over the 1895-1910 period. While this historical climate period does not overlap with the entirety of the European agricultural settlement era, this climatic period is the oldest for which we have reliable estimates of temperature and precipitation in the region. Precipitation seasonality was calculated from Monthly Prism datasets as follows: 

SI = sum 1-12(abs(mi - P/12))/P * 100

Temperature is calculated using the coefficient of variation method
TSI = sd(m1....m12)/Tavgannual *100
 
  
*Soil data*

  Soils data are derived from statewide gSSURGO 10m raster data product (<https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=NRCS142P2_053628>).  The weighted averages from the top 30cm of the soil were calculated for % sand, available water content (awc), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat) soil parameters using the gSSURGO On-Demand ArcGIS toolbox (<https://github.com/ncss-tech/ssurgoOnDemand.git>). Weighted averages were calculated on the statewide soil raster datasets for Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois, then weighted average rasters were mosaicked together to produce one single raster dataset. Maps of soil parameters were then aggregated to a 1km grid scale and an 8km Great Lakes St. Lawrence projected grid scale (PalEON dataset scale).

*Pricipal Component Analysis*

Since many climate and soils variables are often correlated, a pricipal components analysis was conducted to reduce dimensions and co-linearity in the environmental data. PCA was coducted on the scaled variables of historic MAP, historic Mean temperature, historic Precipitation Seasonality Index, Historic Tempearture Seasonality, AWC, and %sand. The modern principal component scores for climatic and soil variables were predicted using the historic principal component model. This method maintains the PCA of modern and historic environmental data on the same scale. The 1st Principal Component (PC1) was then used as a covariate when assessing bimodality. 

  
*Bimodality analysis*

Criteria for bimodality uses a both a bimodality coefficient (BC) and Hartigans Diptest for unimodality. Bimodality Coefficient is calculated from size, skewness, and kurtosis of the distributions (Pfister et al. 2013). A BC greater than 0.556 suggests bimodality. Bimodality coefficient (BC) is calculated from the distribuiton of data as follows using the R package 'modes':

BC = $\frac{(skew^2 + 1)}{(kurtosis + 3)*\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2)*(n-3)}}$

Desnity distributions of the PLS and FIA data were estimated. We then calculated the BC and performed Hartigan's diptest for unimodaltity for the on these smoothed density distribuitons for the PLS and FIA overall, and the BC within different bins of precipitation and the 1st Principal Component. Hartigan's diptest has a null hypothesis of a unimodal distribution of the data (CITE). This provides one BC value for a given range of precipitation/PC and whether the distribution is significantly different from a unimodal distribution. These ranges are used to determine the climate space where savannas and closed forests coexist.  

*Generalized Additive Models*

In addition to evaluating the BC for ranges of data, we developed several generalized additive models (GAMs) to determine if tree density can be deterministically predicted by climate and/or soils. GAMs were developed with both strictly additive terms and with flexible smooth terms. The full PLS data and FIA data were separated into two random halves that make up the testing and training datasets. GAM's were developed with the training dataset, and prediction error was estimated using the test dataset. Model parsimony was evaluated basing on AIC values, and model fit was assessed using RMSE. 

*Future Forest Stability under CMIP5 projected climate scenarios*

To investigate the consequences of the modern climate-vegetation relationship, and the past climate-vegetation relatiohsip would have for the stability of future midwestern forests, we utilized climate projections from CMIP5 representative concentration pathways (rcps) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. We obtained average monthly precipitation, total annual precipitation, average monthly temperature, and average annual temperature projections for 2070-2099 under the three RCP scenarios from the CCESM4 GCM climate downscaled climate projections (from worldclim, cite). We calculated precipitation and temperature seasonality as described above. Principal componenet scores (based on the past climate PCA) were assigned for each grid cell using the projected climate data from each RCP. 

We then identified the climate space (within PC1) that was bimodal in the PLS time, and mapped where this climate space is projected to be in 2070-2100. We also identified the climate space where FIA forests were bimodal on the modern landscape, and where this climate space would be in 2070-2100.



## Discussion:

  Tree density in the past was significantly bimodal, and was not accounted for by climate or soil factors, supporting our hypothesis that savannas and forests were alternative stable states in the region.  Projecting the past climate-vegeation relationship onto the modern climate would drive shifts in the climate space where bistable tree distributions are possible, but continue to predict large extent of savanna and forest alternative stable states on the modern landscape. However, modern tree density is no longer bimodal on the modern landscape, suggesting an unexpected shift towards stable closed forests in the region. Neither past tree density nor modern tree density has a fully deterministic relationship with climate, but bimodality in past tree density is predominant at intermediate temperature and precipitation space.  These largescale shifts from alternative savanna and forest stable states towards stable closed forests indicate that land use changes (fire suppression, logging, agricultural conversion) have had a far greater impact on midwestern woody ecosystems than changes in climate over the last ~150 years.  
  
  Land use changes that have led to fire suppression and land conversion in the region have long been hypothesized to drive "mesophication" (Nowacki and Abrams 2008), and increases in woody cover in the region. Additionally, small scale studies indicate that historic geography that would act as fire breaks (rivers and topography) are important explanatory variables for PLS vegetation (Grimm 1984). Modern land management strategies for restoring open savannas and grasslands in the region require extensive cutting and prescribed burns to limit understory tree growth (CITE). (CITE) suggest that a shift in overall fire return intervals have shifted southern midwest savanna and grasslands towards mesophytic forests and require larger and longer efforts of prescribed burns to return these ecosystems to their open states. While there has been small scale evidence that fire and disturbances were historically important for the maintence of temperate savanna-forest boundary in the US, our study is the first to document evidence for alternative savanna and forest stable states across a large region of the midwest. Additionally, the modern landscape after long term land use changes and post-settlement fire suppression has become mostly stable forests. 
  
  Evidence for alternative savanna and forest stable states in the temperate Midwest provides evidence that bistable systems are not constricted to the tropics. In the tropics, intermediate precipitation and high precipiation seasonality is the climatic domain for alternative stable states. However, our finding of temperate alternative stable states at much lower precipitaiton levels and temperatures, indicate that the constraints on growth identified in the tropics do not impose hard limits on the extent of these systems globally. Rather, we propose that alternative stable states are constrained to regions of intemediate moisture, where disturbance feedbacks occur. 

  Overall the shifts between the modern landscape and the pre-European settlement is marked by large scale forest stabilization, a shift from bimodal distribution in tree cover characterized by closed forests and open savannas, to mostly closed forested ecosystems. Throughtout the holocene, shifts in tree composition and tree cover have been linked to climatic variability across the region (CITE). However, this recent shift is not predicted by the observed changes in temperature, precipitation, or T/P seasonality. Rather, we propose that increased fire suppression and removal of disturbances from the landscape as likely mechanisms for overall shift towards closed forests. However, lack of direct evidence for the mechanism of these shifts makes it difficult to direct attribute the cause. Additonally, increases in atmospheric CO2 have been hypothesized to have a CO2 fertilization effect on tree growth, and could increase forest cover by increasing growth and tree recruitment (Wycoff and Bowers, CITE recruitment paper). To determine how much a CO2 fertilization effect may have contributed to increased forest cover in the Midwest, mechanistic evidence for CO2 fertilization in the region is needed. 
  
  The distribution of tree density across the region and the stabiliity of ecosystems to envrionmental changes can have large consequences for future biodiversity, carbon storage, and management decisions. Although evidence for alternative savanna and forest stable states in the midwest and throughout the globe suggest the potential for large scale forest/biome instability with changes in climate, ongoing land use changes and fires suppression have historically stabilized forests in the midwest. While increased stability of terrestrial ecosytems is a positive effects of the "mesophication" and overall conversion of savannas and grasslands to forests, it may come at the large cost of species biodiversity loss, increased vegetation homogenity, and loss of habitat. Assuming current land cover strategies continue, the modern forests are not likely to revert back to savanna in response of climate. However, increased likelihood of fire disturbances and further land use changes that may accompany changes in climate could alter the stability of the region. Being able to identify forest stability, and vegetation responses to different types of environmental changes will be important to understanding the trajectory of future forest and savanna biomes.

We predict the binomial probability of having closed forest (tree density over 47 trees/hectare) given precipation, temperature, precip seasonality, temperature seasonality, % sand and awc. We get a decrease in probability of forests predicted in the open savanna regions, but the places with intermediate probability suggest unstable intermediates where savannas and forests are equally probable given the environmental data.

###Predicting Tree density (GAMs)

The model with the lowest AIC value is represented by the formula:
PLSdensity ~ s(MAP) + s(MAT) + s(TempCV) + s(PrecipSI) + s(% sand) + s(awc)

Addtionally, for the FIA dataset the model with the lowest AIC also includes MAP, MAT, TempCV, PrecipSI, % sand, and awc. However, the model fits for the modern landscape are substantially lower.

The predicted vs. observed plot shows overestimation of PLS tree density in Low density areas and underestimation of PLS tree density in High density areas. Below we map out the predictions and prediction errors in space. Model fit has improved for the stable portions of the PLS landscape, and does an Okay job predicting PLS tree density. Note that the predictions here are overall much higher than the observations for FIA tree denisty.

```
PLS model trained on the stable places results in high overpredictions for low tree denisty areas and moderate underprediction for tree density in high density grid cells. 

FIA models overpredict over the places that have low tree denisty. I think that if we remove the low denisty places, we might be able to better predict. 


## Predicting Forest vs. Savanna (not density)

The above models are predicting density (continious variable) from continous envrionmental and climate covariates. However, we can also use the savanna/forest density classificaitons as our y variable and  predict the probability a grid cell is forest (ecocode = 1, PLS density > 47 trees/ha) and savannna (ecocode = 0, PLSdensity < 47 trees/ha & >0.5 trees/ha) from continous environmental and climate covariates. 


This method has the benefit of predicting the probability of forest (or the probability of savanna) given certain environmental conditions. For this analysis, we exclude prairie sites

Looks like model number 14 with just Mean Annual Precipitation has lowest AIC for the logistic/binomial model. 
Lets map out the probability of forest based on model with the lowest AIC value:

forest type ~ s(MAP1910)+ s(pasttmean) + s(deltaT) +   s(pastdeltaP)

The smooth predictors in this model are the same as the smooth predictors in the denisty model
