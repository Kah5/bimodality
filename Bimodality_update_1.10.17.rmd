#Bimodality Figures Updates:
##Updated: January 10th, 2017

#### Overall Distributions of density & tree cover
#### We know that PLS tree density is bimodal and FIA tree density is not:
![PLS density](outputs/PLS_density_histogrom.png) 
![FIA density](outputs/FIA_density_histogram.png)

#### PLS % canopy cover also might be slightly bimodal, but it is not that informative:
![PLS cover](outputs/v1.6/PLS_cover_histogrom.png)

#### The past climate space of the Midwest is broad spans a large range of precipitation and temperature. Neither one of these parameters fully explains the distribution in tree density:
![Temperature vs Precip](outputs/v1.6/precip_vs_temp_full_pls.png)

##Progress to date on Key Bimodality paper Figures:
We discussed some key analyses and figures that we wanted to show. Basically, we want to demonstrate that PLS is bimodal in terms of tree density, and the modern landscape is not bimodal. 

We want to demonstrate that the distribution in tree density is not well contstrained/predicted by the generally hypothesized drivers of tree density and the prairie-savanna-forest ecotone.
  *Moisture 
  *Drought
  *Soil type / soil texture (Danz 2010)
  *Temperature
  *seasonality of temperature
  *seasonality of precipitaiton
  *slope/elevation (firebreaks and soil moisture)

Next we want to quantify the climate/environmental spaces where the bimodality is most prominant. This is important because it will tell us where the forests could switch to savannas and where savannas could actually become forests. We want to have an 'index of bimodality' that indicates the degree to which a density distribution is bimodal.

###Figure 2: 
Bimodality Index for PLS and FIA (i.e. how bimodal the data is) in different sliding windows or different bins of precipitation (OR water balance OR Principal Component 1)
* Still working on calculating a “Bimodality index,” some options we may have for this:
  + Dip Test (null = unimodal distribution)
  + Bimodality Coefficient calculated from size, skewness, and kurtosis of the distributions, though there may be issues with both BC and the Dip test (Pfister et al. 2013)
  + BC > 0.556 suggests bimodality
  + BC can be calculated in the R package modes 

####Notably, looking at different binwidths of mean annual precipitation gives us a slightly different answer for the index of bimodality at each precipitation range:

####Bin range of 100, non-overlapping bins:
![PLS 100 bins](outputs/v1.6/bimodality_coefficient_full_pls_100bins.png) 

####Bin range of 75, non-overlapping bins:
![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/bimodality_coefficient_full_pls_75bins.png) 

####Bin range of 25, non-overlapping bins:
![PLS 25 bins](outputs/v1.6/bimodality_coefficient_full_pls_25bins.png) 

#### Additionally, we can have overlapping bins, where each new "bin of precpitation" is offset by 10mm/year, which also present a slightly different picture.
####Bin range of 100, overlapping bins:
![PLS 100 bins](outputs/v1.6/rolling_BC_plots_100.png)
####Bin range of 75, overlapping bins:
![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/rolling_BC_plots_75.png)
##Bin range of 25, overlapping bins:
![PLS 25 bins](outputs/v1.6/rolling_BC_plots_25.png)


####we can do the same for FIA plots & cover (not shown here)

### Figure 3: Plot of Bimodality index vs. Density (not sure how to do this, since a high BC inherently means that we have both high and low densities)

### Figure 4:
We can make maps of the precipitation climate space where BC > 5.5 from the BC values of non-overlapping bins of width = 75mm in Figure 2:

#### Map of bimodality for PLS:![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/PLS_BC_map_75.png)

### Map of bimodality for FIA:![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/FIA_BC_map_75.png)

### The map for PLS density bimodality does roughly match with the Map of bimodality for PLS % cover estimates (which makes sense)
