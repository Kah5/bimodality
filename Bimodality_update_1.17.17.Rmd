Paper outline:


1. Intro:
  * Biome theory overview
  * Savanna-grassland-forest alternative stable states and fire dominated regions defy biome theory & make it difficult to project into the future
    + Bimodal distribution in tree cover/tree density that is not deterministically predicted by climate or environmental factors is a hallmark of alternative stable state. 
  * Alt. stable states have been well documented in the modern day tropics, but studies documenting alternative stable states in temperate regions of the world are scarce. However, if fire/disturbance driven alternative stable states once existed in parts of the temperate zone, large scale fire suppression in N. America (@nowacki_2008) and Europe (CITE??) would have removed the vegetation-disturbance feedbacks from the landscape. 
  * However, the existance of a large ecotone from open prairies and savannas to eastern closed forests in the North American Midwest might suggest otherwise. 
  * recent digitatization of historical records of past vegetation in the North American midwest allows us to test for the characteristic bimodality in vegetation w.r.t. climate in the past. We hypothesize that regional fire suppression efforts contirbuted to the removal of vegetation-disturbance feedbacks, leading to an increase in forests in previously savanna and open areas.

### Start Paper Draft

Biome theory overview:
Conceptually, biome thoery suggests that there is a predictible relationship between the global distribution of vegetation and environmental drivers. This hypothesized link between vegetation and its environment is the basis for simple ecosystem and dynamic vegetation models, which we often use to make predictions for a future under a changing climate and higher CO~2~. However, biomes with alternative states have two very different vegetation types that can occur within the same climate and environmental space. Thus, in biomes/regions with alternative stable states, vegetation is not a direct function of the environmet, make predictions into the future uncertain (CITE review paper).  


  Biomes that can switch between Savanna and forest systems are an example of alternative states that are not directly predictable from climate and environental factors. In large areas of the tropics climate and edaphic factors are uninformative in predicting distribution of tree cover, but tree cover may be a result of disturbance-vegetation feedbacks(@staver_2011). The association of open savannas regions with high fire frequencies suggest that disturbance-vegetation feedbacks play a role in maintaining savanna & forest as alternative stable states (@staver_2011). Specifically, fire is associated with open savanna ecosystems with intermediate climates, where high grassy fuel loads in open understory systems promote fire spread, which prevents understory trees from establishing. However at these same climates, closed forests may be present but light limition in the understory prevents fuel buildup, suppressing the likelihood of fire (@hoffmann_2012). These vegetation-disturbance feedbacks drive will drive regions of intermediate tree cover either towards a closed forest state in the absence of disturbance, or towards an open savanna state in the presence of disturbance. These vegetation feedback forces result in a bimodal distribution of tree cover/tree density at a landscape or regional scale, with a high frequency of open and closed ecosystems, but few ecosystems with intermediate tree cover. Thus, the existence of alternative states is demonstrated by a bimodal distribution in tree density that is not well predicted by climate, but could be attributed to endogenous feedbacks.

Savanna and forest alternative states have been well documented in the tropics(@staver_2011, @hoffmann_2012, @dantas_2016a), but have not been well documented elsewhere on the landscape. The relience of alternative states on disturbance-vegetation feedbacks would predict that alternative states are likely in fire prone regions outside of the tropics as well. However, studies documenting alternative stable states in temperate regions of the world are scarce. However, if fire/disturbance driven alternative stable states once existed in parts of the temperate zone, large scale fire suppression in N. America (@nowacki_2008) and Europe (CITE??) would have removed the vegetation-disturbance feedbacks from the landscape. 

While the Upper Midwest in North American is largely forested or agricultural land use today, historical vegetation surveys documented open savanna regions in the region before the time of European settlement (@transeau_1935, @grimm_1984, @danz_2011, @goring_2016). Several alternative hypotheses for the existance of open savanna ecosystems in the mesic/temperate midwest have been proposed, resulting in a complex understanding of the historic controls on vegetation in the past. At a very large scale, a gradual east to west moisture/precipitation gradient limits tree growth, resulting in transistions from Forest to tall, mixed, and shortgrass prairie (CITE @transeau_1935). High Temperatures could inteact with precipiation by increaseing evapotranspiration, creating drought conditions (@danz_2011). In the seasonally dry topics, the seasonality of rainfall is an important determinant of vegetation, but there is very low temperature seasonality. While the N. American midwest often experiences late summer droughts, the temperate zone experiences marked temperature seasonality (CITE for how this affects vegetation).In addition to this gradual moisture limiation, high drainage in fast draining sandy soils can create wate limitations on tree growth, creating savanna ecosystems in mesic ecosystems (@grimm_1984, CITE others). Topography can also faciliate water limitation by decreasing soil moisture on upslope sites, and altering solar insolation driven evapotranspiration (CITE ). Not all hypothesized drivers of the Midwestern savanna-forest ecotone have been deterministic; topographic fire breaks distiguish open prairie & savanna from the closed forest in the Big Woods of Minnesota (@grimm_1984) and historically forested regions of the P-F boundary in Minnesota are more topographically complex than historic prairie sites (@danz_2011). Anecdotal accounts of anthropogenic and natural prairie fires support this idea that fire disturbances were historically important influences on the past landscape (CITE). However, to date there have been no studies to document historic forest & savanna vegetation as alterative stable states (come up with a better transistion). 
  
However, if fire/disturbance driven alternative stable states once existed in parts of the temperate zone, large scale fire suppression and extensive land use change & fragmentation in N. America (@nowacki_2008, @rheumtella_2007) and Europe (CITE??) would have removed the vegetation-disturbance feedbacks from the landscape, making the alternative stable states in the temperate zone (should they exist) unobservable today. The recent digitization of pre-European settlement vegetation data in the N. American Upper Midest provides a glimpse into past vegetaton and allows us to test the hypothesis that the distribution of vegetation in the past is bimodal with respect to climate, and that the commonly cited hypothesized drivers do not predict the distribution of vegetation in the past (reword/develop the hypotheses so they are stronger). 

##Methods:
*Public Land Survey Data:*
The Public Land Survey was commissioned by the U.S. General Land Office to assess the quality of land/timber and assign land titles for Euro-american settlers. The surveyors placed corner posts at every 1mile section corners in a grid within each township. At these section corners, and at 1/4 section corners, the surveyors would record the distance and azimuth from the corner to the nearest two trees, the species of the nearest two trees, and the diameter at breast height (DBH) of those trees. Afte these historic records are digitized (cite Mladenoff et al. ), we estimate the denisty and basal area at each corner point using the unbiased morista density estimator (@goring_2016, CITE Cogbill). Tree density is then averaged across 8km grid cells in the upper Midwest.

*Forest Inventory Analysis Data:*
Add FIA data methods from Sean/Simon/Jack

*Prism Data*
  * cite prism data
  * add seasonality calculations
*gSSURGO soil data*
  * cite soil data
  * gSSURGO processing steps
  Soils data are derived from statewide gSSURGO 10m raster data product (<https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=NRCS142P2_053628>).  The weighted averages from the top 30cm of the soil were calculated for % sand, available water content (awc), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat) soil parameters using the gSSURGO On-Demand ArcGIS toolbox <https://github.com/ncss-tech/ssurgoOnDemand.git>. Weighted averages were calculated on the statewide soil raster datasets for Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois, then weighted average rasters were mosaicked together to produce one single raster dataset. Maps of soil parameters were then aggregated to a 1km grid scale and an 8km Great Lakes St. Lawrence projected grid scale (PalEON dataset scale) in R.
  
*Bimodality analysis*
  * Bimodality coefficient:
  * Dip Test (null = unimodal distribution)
  * Bimodality Coefficient calculated from size, skewness, and kurtosis of the distributions, though there may be issues with both BC and the Dip test (Pfister et al. 2013)
  * BC > 0.556 suggests bimodality
  * BC is calculated with be calculated in the R package modes
  
Bimodality coefficient is calculated from a distribuiton of data as follows:

BC = $\frac{(skew^2 + 1)}{(kurtosis + 3)*\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2)*(n-3)}}$


*Pricipal Component Analysis*
Since many climate and soils variables are often correlated, a pricipal components analysis was conducted to reduce dimensions and co-linearity in the environmental data.

*Generalized Additive Models*
Several generalized additive models were developed to determine which regions are deterministically predicted by climate & soils. 


##Results:
Tree density in the past PLS is bimodal across the entire upper midwest, while the modern landscape is not. Precipitation or Temperature along do not deterimine the distribution of treee density across the PLS landscape.


##Key questions we aim to answer in this analysis:
1. Was the N.American pre-euro settlement tree cover/tree density bimodal? Is the modern landscape bimodal?
2. Does climate explain the distribution of tree density in either the past or the modern landscape?
3. Do soil factors/elevation explain tree density in either the past or the modern landscape?
4. What is the climate/soil/environmental space where the past had alternative stable density states? How bimodal is the distribution? Where is this located within the N. American Midwest?
5. Based on this climate/soil/environmental space, where should this bimodality be observed? (acknowledging that climate has changed over the last century)

We use the density data from the places where we have both Public Land Survey data (past), and Forest Inventory Analysis data (modern) across the upper midwest:

![](outputs/v1.6/tree_density_maps_PLS_FIA.png)

## Q1. Was the N.American pre-euro settlement tree cover/tree density bimodal? Is the modern landscape bimodal?

Ans. Public land survey tree density is bimodal and FIA tree density is not:

![](outputs/v1.6-5/FIA_PLS_hists.png) 

Additionally, places that historically had low tree density in the past now have higher tree density, while those that were dense in the past have decreased in tree density:


![](outputs/v1.6-5/density_difference_plot.png)


## Q2. Does climate explain the distribution of tree density in either the past or the modern landscape?

The past and modern climate space of the Midwest is broad spans a large range of precipitation and temperature. 

![](outputs/v1.6-5/precip_vs_temp_FIA_PLS.png)

PLS & FIA tree density are not readily explained by the gradient in Precipitation, but tree denisty bimodality appears to occur between 600-900 mm/year in the past. 

![](outputs/FIA_PLS_hexbinplots.png) 

PLS & FIA density are not obviously explained as a function of mean annual temperature, but the bimodality in tree density appears to occur between 0-10 DegC in the past:

![](outputs/FIA_PLS_temp_hexbinplots.png)


##Q3. Do soil factors/elevation explain tree density in either the past or the modern landscape?

Ans. % Sand, Available Water Content (awc), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat) do not explain tree density overall on their own. Additionally, PC1 and PC2 from a Principle Components Analysis do not explain tree density.

![](outputs/v1.6/FIA_PLS_PC1_hexbinplots.png)

Additionally, the biplot for the Principal Components Analysis:
![](outputs/v1.6/pca_biplot.png)



## Q4. What is the environmental space where the past was bimodal? How bimodal is the distribution? Where is this located within the N. American Midwest?

Ans. We can look at bins of precipitation to get an idea of where this bimodality coefficient is likely to be highest:

![](outputs/v1.6/precipitation_by_bins_100.png)

We can look at the bins of temperature to get an idea of where the BC is likely to be highest:
![](outputs/v1.6/tmean_by_bins.png)

We can also look at the density distribution with bins of the first Principal Component of the environmental data:

![](outputs/v1.6/PC1_by_bins.png)

We can also look at the density distribution with bins of the second Principal Component of the environmental data:

![](outputs/v1.6/PC2_by_bins.png)

####To fully answer this question of how bimodal the density is, we have to define a bimodality index. There are a few options for this:
  * Dip Test (null = unimodal distribution)
  * Bimodality Coefficient calculated from size, skewness, and kurtosis of the distributions, though there may be issues with both BC and the Dip test (Pfister et al. 2013)
  * BC > 0.556 suggests bimodality
  * BC is calculated with be calculated in the R package modes
  
Bimodality coefficient is calculated from a distribuiton of data as follows:

BC = $\frac{(skew^2 + 1)}{(kurtosis + 3)*\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2)*(n-3)}}$

Here we calculated the BC for a bin range of 25mm of precipitation, with non-overlapping and overlapping bins:

![](outputs/v1.6/PLS_FIA_precip_roll_nonroll_BC_bins.png)

We can also calculate BC of the Principal components (this is not as easily interpretable as binning by precipitation):
![](outputs/v1.6-5/PLS_FIA_PC1_PC2_BC_bins.png)


## Where is the bimodality located within the N. American Midwest?

Within the places that were bimodal in the past, and that are bimodal now, we want to know which were savannas and which were forests. We use a classificaiton scheme from Rheumtella et al. (), However there are alternate classificaitons that we could use, such as the scheme Chicago Wilderness has used. We could also make our own classification schemes using kmeans clustering.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Table 1: Site table with highest correlation, year cored, and species present.'}

library(knitr)
library(pander)

df <- data.frame(Ecotype = c("Forest", "Savanna", "Prairie"),
                 Rheumtella = c("> 47 trees/ha", "0.5-47 trees/ha", "< 0.5 trees/ha"), ChicagoWilderness = c("> 100 trees/ha", "10-100 trees/ha", "< 10 trees/ha"))

pander(df, split.cells = 30)
```

### Ecotypes using the Chicago Wilderness classification
![](outputs/v1.6-5/PLS_FIA_ecotype_cw_map.png)

### Where is the precipitation range where PLS and FIA densities are bimodal?
  * Precipitation climate space where BC > 5.5 
  * Using the BC values of non-overlapping bins of width = 25mm 
  * Bimodality occurs at both Low precipitation (525-600mm/year) and intermediate precipitation (800-1125 mm/year) in the past
  * Bimodality occurs less frequently on the modern landscape, but also at some low precipitations (575-625 mm/year) and some intemediate precipitations(975 - 1150 mm/year ) on the modern landscape. 

![](outputs/v1.6-5/PLS_FIA_precip_BC_map.png)

### Where is the temperature range where PLS and FIA densities are bimodal?
  * Places that are bimodal across temperature ranges (i.e. not linearly predicted by temperature) are mostly located in southern WI, and Indiana and Illinois.
  * This might suggest that some of the bimodality that occurs at intermediate preicipitation could be due to differences in temperature
  * The temperature range where tree density is bimodal is 7-10 degC.
  
![](outputs/v1.6-5/PLS_FIA_temp_1.5_deg_BC_map.png) 

### What is the 'climate space' in terms of Principal components where PLS and FIA density is bimodal?
  * Temperature and Precipitation dominate loadings of the PC1 
  * PC1 shows a similar region of bimodal savanna and forests as the temperature map
  * soil factors (sand, ksat) dominate the loadings of PC2
  * PC2 predicts stable savannas in regions with sandy soils, but the PC2 has bimodalities elsewhere in the midwest
  * When we map the places that are bimodal in both PC1 and PC2, we have an idea of the places that are bimodal after accounting for soils, temperature & precipitation

#### Principle Component 1 (temperature & precipitation)
![](outputs/v1.6-5/PLS_FIA_PC1_BC_map.png)

#### Principle Component 2 (soils)
![](outputs/v1.6-5/PLS_FIA_PC2_BC_map.png)

### Bimodality in both PC1 and PC2 space (accounting for temp., precip, & soils)
![](outputs/v1.6-5/PLS_FIA_PC1_PC2_BC_map.png)

####Interpretation: 
Within precipiation ranges that have bistablity, differences in temperature may account for differences in tree density. Other regions that are bimodal w.r.t. precipitaiton can be explained by soil factors, such as differences in soil sandiness (PC2). However, a small subset of areas are bimodal in both PC2 and PC1 space.   

## Summary:
  * PLS density is bimodal, while the modern density is not
  * We may be able to explain some of the distribution in tree density using envrionmental variables (above, and see GAM table)
  * However, none of the environmental variables here fully account for the the bimodality in the PLS data
  * We demonstrate that a large region of the midwest historically could have been either savanna or forest alternative states that are not predicted by precipiation.
  * More of the bimodality in PLS tree distribution is accounted for by tempearature and soils, but not all. 
  * The determininants on bimodality 
  * Athough historically, this region supported both savanna and forest states, the modern landscape has vitually no bimodal regions. This suggests that fire suppression, land use, and environmental changes that have occurred over the last ~ 150 years may have played a role in the decline of alternative savanna & forest states in the region. 

## Questions/things to work on:
  * Are there other variables that we should include?
  * Potentially including PDSI from LBDA
  * Figure predicting where the Midwest could be bimodal based on future climate
  * In terms of framing the paper, I need to discuss the regional environmental changes (fire suppresion, land use) in a way that makes it clear that these changes could have removed the endogenous vegetation feedbacks that are important for maintaining alt. stable states.
