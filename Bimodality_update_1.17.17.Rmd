To DO:
  *PCA of envtl variables?
  *solidify list of envtl variables
  *calculate bimodality coefiicient over bins of the PC1?
  *check veil lines

Biome theory overview:
Conceptually, biome thoery suggests that there is a predictible relationship between the global distribution of vegetation and environmental drivers. This hypothesized link between vegetation and its environment is the basis for simple ecosystem and dynamic vegetation models, which we often use to make predictions for a future under a changing climate and higher CO~2~. However, biomes with alternative states have two very different vegetation types that can occur within the same climate and environmental space. Thus, in biomes/regions with alternative stable states, vegetation is not a direct function of the environmet, make predictions into the future uncertain.  

Savannas in biome theory & midwest:
Biomes that can switch between Savanna and forest systems are an example of alternative states that are not directly predictable from climate and environental factors. In large areas of the tropics climate and edaphic factors are uninformative in predicting distribution of tree cover, but tree cover may be a result of disturbance-vegetation feedbacks. Fire is linked to open savanna regions within intermediate climates, where high grassy fuel loads promote fire spread. However at these same climates, closed forests may be present but light limition in the understory prevents fuel buildup, suppressing the likelihood of fire. The association of open savannas regions with high fire frequencies suggest that disturbance-vegetation feedbacks play a role in maintaining savanna & forest as alternative stable states (Staver et al.). The existence of alternative states is demonstrated by a bimodal distribution in tree density that is not well predicted by climate, but could be attributed to endogenous feedbacks.

Savanna and forest alternative states have been well documented in the tropics(Staver et al. 2011, Hoffmann et al. 2012, Dantas 2016), but have not been well documented elsewhere on the landscape. 





several alternative explanations for midwest savannas

Key questions we aim to answer:
1. Were north American landscapes from pre-euro settlement bimodal in terms of tree cover/tree density?
2. Does climate explain the distribution of tree density in either the past or the modern landscape?
3. Do soil factors/elevation explain tree denisity in either the past or the modern landscape?
4. What is the climate/soil/environmental space where the past had alternative stable density states? Where is this located within the N. American Midwest?
5. Based on this climate/soil/environmental space, where should this bimodality be observed? (acknowledging that climate has changed over the last century)

#### Overall Distributions of density & tree cover
#### We know that PLS tree density is bimodal and FIA tree density is not:

![](outputs/FIA_PLS_hists.png) 


#### The past climate space of the Midwest is broad spans a large range of precipitation and temperature. Neither one of these parameters fully explains the distribution in tree density:
![](outputs/v1.6/precip_vs_temp_full_pls.png)

##Progress to date on Key Bimodality paper Figures:
We discussed some key analyses and figures that we wanted to show. Basically, we want to demonstrate that PLS is bimodal in terms of tree density, and the modern landscape is not bimodal. 

We want to demonstrate that the distribution in tree density is not well contstrained/predicted by the generally hypothesized drivers of tree density and the prairie-savanna-forest ecotone.
  *Moisture 
  *Drought
  *Soil type / soil texture (Danz 2010)
  *Temperature
  *seasonality of temperature
  *seasonality of precipitaiton
  *slope/elevation (firebreaks and soil moisture)
  *VPD (dont have this but could include it)

Next we want to quantify the climate/environmental spaces where the bimodality is most prominant. This is important because it will tell us where the forests could switch to savannas and where savannas could actually become forests. We want to have an 'index of bimodality' that indicates the degree to which a density distribution is bimodal. Here it is plotted as a function of precipitation, be we are also interested in the relationship of tree density to other environmental variables. We should look at the relationship between density and a Principal component of the environmental variables. 

If we know the environmental space where places were bimdal in the past, we can ask...are they still bimodal? How have those places changed?

###Figure 2: 
Bimodality Index for PLS and FIA (i.e. how bimodal the data is) in different sliding windows or different bins of precipitation (OR water balance OR Principal Component 1)
* Still working on calculating a “Bimodality index,” some options we may have for this:
  + Dip Test (null = unimodal distribution)
  + Bimodality Coefficient calculated from size, skewness, and kurtosis of the distributions, though there may be issues with both BC and the Dip test (Pfister et al. 2013)
  + BC > 0.556 suggests bimodality
  + BC can be calculated in the R package modes 

####Notably, looking at different binwidths of mean annual precipitation gives us a slightly different answer for the index of bimodality at each precipitation range:

####Bin range of 100, non-overlapping bins:
![PLS 100 bins](outputs/v1.6/bimodality_coefficient_full_pls_100bins.png) 

####Bin range of 75, non-overlapping bins:
![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/bimodality_coefficient_full_pls_75bins.png) 

####Bin range of 25, non-overlapping bins:
![PLS 25 bins](outputs/v1.6/bimodality_coefficient_full_pls_25bins.png) 

#### Additionally, we can have overlapping bins, where each new "bin of precpitation" is offset by 10mm/year, which also present a slightly different picture.
####Bin range of 100, overlapping bins:
![PLS 100 bins](outputs/v1.6/rolling_BC_plots_100.png)
####Bin range of 75, overlapping bins:
![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/rolling_BC_plots_75.png)
##Bin range of 25, overlapping bins:
![PLS 25 bins](outputs/v1.6/rolling_BC_plots_25.png)


####we can do the same for FIA plots & cover (not shown here)

### Figure 3: Plot of Bimodality index vs. Density (not sure how to do this, since a high BC inherently means that we have both high and low densities)

### Figure 4:
We can make maps of the precipitation climate space where BC > 5.5 from the BC values of non-overlapping bins of width = 75mm in Figure 2:

#### Map of bimodality for PLS:![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/PLS_BC_map_75.png)

### Map of bimodality for FIA:![PLS 75 bins](outputs/v1.6/FIA_BC_map_75.png)

### The map for PLS density bimodality does roughly match with the Map of bimodality for PLS % cover estimates (which makes sense)
